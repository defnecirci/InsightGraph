{"L255": "The electrical and dielectric properties of polyamide 6 (PA6)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) nanocomposites prepared by melt mixing were investigated by employing dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in broad frequency (10\u22122\u2013106                      Hz) and temperature ranges (from \u2212150 to 150\u00b0C). Transmission electron microscopy revealed a good state of CNT dispersion in the polymeric matrix. The percolation threshold (p                      c) was found to be 1.7 vol.% by using the dependence of both dc conductivity and critical frequency (f                      c) from dc to ac transition on vol.% concentration in MWCNT. The actual aspect ratio of the nanotubes in the nanocomposites was calculated using a theoretical model (proposed by Garboczi et al.) and the obtained value was correlated with the p                      c value according to the excluded volume theory. Additionally, the contact resistance (R                      c) between the conductive nanotubes was found to be \u223c105                      \u03a9. Investigation of the temperature dependence of conductivity revealed a charge transport which is controlled by thermal fluctuation-induced tunneling for temperatures up to the glass transition. Finally, it was shown that the addition of nanotubes has no significant influence on the relaxation mechanisms of the PA6 matrix.", "L292": "Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of the inorganic phase on the polymeric relaxation dynamics in PMMA/silica hybrids synthesized in situ via sol\u2013gel processes. It was found that the large-scale molecular motions of PMMA were influenced by the addition of silica, inducing longer mean relaxation times, more heterogeneous relaxing environments and the higher activation energy. Explanations based on hydrogen-bond interactions between two phases and a fraction of entrapped chain segments in silica networks were proposed to understand the influence of the silica.", "L141": "15 nm diameter SiO2 nanoparticles with a grafted block copolymer consisting of a 5\u201320 nm rubbery polyhexylmethacrylate (PHMA) inner block and a 30 nm outer block of matrix compatible polyglycidylmethacrylate (PGMA) were synthesized to toughen an epoxy. A systematic study of the effect of block copolymer graft density (from 0.07 to 0.7 chains/nm2) and block molecular weight (from 20 to 80 kg/mol) on the tensile behavior, fracture toughness, and fatigue properties was conducted. It was found that the copolymer grafted SiO2 nanoparticles enhanced the ductility (maximum 60% improvement), fracture toughness (maximum 300% improvement) and fatigue crack growth resistance of the epoxy matrix while maintaining the modulus at loadings of less than 2 vol% of silica core. The PHMA block induced plastic void growth and shear banding. At lower graft density and larger molecular weight of the PHMA block, the nanocomposites exhibited simultaneous improvements in fracture toughness and tensile modulus. The PGMA epoxy compatible block also contributed to the improved fracture energy of the nanocomposites.", "L162": "Two different types of high aspect ratio flexible nanofibers, cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes, were dispersed in an amorphous thermoplastic polymer matrix. The mechanical and (in the case of carbon nanotubes filled composites) electrical properties of these composites were investigated. Dynamic mechanical analysis highlighted the influence of entanglements between fibers and of fiber/fiber contact properties on the composite mechanical reinforcement in the rubbery state. In the case of cellulose filled nanocomposites a large mechanical reinforcement effect was observed. This effect was explained by the formation of a rigid nanofibril network linked by strong hydrogen bonds. The formation of this network was assumed to be governed by a percolation mechanism. Conversely, when such bonds between cellulose fibrils were prevented by the process, a lower mechanical reinforcement is observed and can be modeled by a classical mean field approach. On the other hand, both types of composites filled with carbon nanotubes (where no strong interactions are possible) highlighted the fact that entanglements are responsible for a strong increase in thermo-mechanical stability but do not influence the mechanical reinforcement. However, carbon nanotubes are good conductive objects and for such nanocomposites, electrical percolation properties were found. The influence of the process on these electrical properties was highlighted and discussed in term of modification of tube\u2013tube contact electrical properties.", "L163": "Well-dispersed high dielectric permittivity titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized utilizing a block copolymer as a template. The nanoparticles were confined within microphase separated domains of sulfonated styrene-b-(ethylene-ran-butylene)-b-styrene (S-SEBS) block copolymers. A crosslinker (vinyltrimethoxysilane) was incorporated into the block copolymer matrices in order to decrease the dielectric loss from the free sulfonic acid groups. Dynamic mechanical analysis experiments confirmed that nanoparticles and crosslinker were confined within the crosslinked sulfonated styrene blocks and had no effect on the chain relaxation behavior of [ethylene-ran-butylene] blocks. Dielectric experiments showed that higher permittivity composites can thus be obtained with a significant decrease in loss tan                      \u03b4 (<0.01) when crosslinked with vinyltrimethoxysilane.", "L198": "In this paper, stacked-cup carbon nanofibers (CNF) were dispersed in the matrix phase of carbon-fiber-reinforced composites based on a high-performance epoxy system with and without modification by an elastomeric triblock copolymer (TCP) for increased toughness. The addition of the TCP provided an enhancement in toughness at the cost of a slight degradation in modulus and strength. The CNFs, on the other hand, provided significantly enhanced strength and stiffness in matrix-dominated configurations, including tension of quasi-isotropic composites and short beam shear strength of both quasi-isotropic and unidirectional composites. Scanning electron microscopy revealed enhanced adhesion between the matrix and carbon fibers with the addition of either TCP or CNFs. However, CNF agglomeration in the studied systems partially offset the energy dissipation processes brought about by the nanofibers, thereby limiting interlaminar fracture toughness enhancements by CNF addition. These results show good promise for CNFs as low-cost reinforcement for composites while offering insight into the codependent morphologies of multi-scale phases and their influence over bulk properties.", "L267": "Despite superior properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), physical properties of the CNT/epoxy composites are not improved significantly because interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the polymer matrix is weak. CNTs were treated by an acidic solution to remove impurities and modified subsequently by amine treatment or plasma oxidation to improve interfacial bonding and dispersion of nanotubes in the epoxy matrix. The functional groups on the surface of treated CNTs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface modified CNTs were embedded in the epoxy resin by ultra-sonication and the cured nanotube containing composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Rheological properties of nanotube containing epoxy resin and mechanical properties of the modified CNT/epoxy composites were improved because the modification of CNTs improved dispersion and interaction between the CNT and the epoxy resin.", "L191": "Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanocomposites were synthesized by in situ polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) in the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles. Their thermal, rheological and mechanical properties were evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), capillary rheometry, tensile and impact fracture tests. The results showed that CaCO3 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the PVC matrix during in situ polymerization of VC with 5.0wt% or less nanoparticles. The glass transition and thermal decomposition temperatures of PVC phase in PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites are shifted toward higher temperatures by the restriction of CaCO3 nanoparticles on the segmental and long-range chain mobility of the PVC phase. The nanocomposites showed shear thinning and power law behaviors. The \u2018ball bearing\u2019 effect of the spherical nanoparticles decreased the apparent viscosity of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposite melts, and the viscosity sensitivity on shear rate of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposite is higher than that of pristine PVC. Moreover, CaCO3 nanoparticles stiffen and toughen PVC simultaneously, and optimal properties were achieved at 5wt% of CaCO3 nanoparticles in Young's modulus, tensile yield strength, elongation at break and Charpy notched impact energy. Detailed examinations of micro-failure micromechanisms of impact and tensile specimens showed that the CaCO3 nanoparticles acted as stress raisers leading to debonding/voiding and deformation of the matrix material around the nanoparticles. These mechanisms also lead to impact toughening of the nanocomposites.", "L270": "Untreated and acid-treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) were used to fabricate MWNT/epoxy composite samples by sonication technique. The effect of MWNT addition and their surface modification on the mechanical properties were investigated. Modified Halpin\u2013Tasi equation was used to evaluate the Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength of the MWNT/epoxy composite samples by the incorporation of an orientation as well as an exponential shape factor in the equation. There was a good correlation between the experimentally obtained Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength values and the modified Halpin\u2013Tsai theory. The fracture surfaces of MWNT/epoxy composite samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope.", "L101": "High dielectric permittivity barium titanate/epoxy resin (BaTiO3/EPR) composites with different size BaTiO3 particles were prepared and their dielectric properties were studied via a wide range of temperature and frequency. The results show that an appropriate silane coupling agent can be used in order to improve the interaction between BaTiO3 and EPR, and subsequently induces a high dielectric permittivity and a low loss tangent. The size and concentration of BaTiO3 particles also have an effect on the microstructure and dielectric property of composites. Additionally, the dielectric properties of the composites with different size of BaTiO3 particles give different temperature dependence because of the existence of phase transition of large size BaTiO3 particles at its Curie temperature.", "L240": "ZnO/low density polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposites with either homogeneous or controlled inhomogeneous dispersions of ZnO nanoparticles were prepared. The dielectric constants of the composites with filler concentrations up to 40 vol.% were measured and compared with the dielectric constants of conventional submicron size ZnO filled LDPE composite. The filler particles were coated with silane coupling agents and mixed with LDPE to take advantage of the high surface area of nanoparticles for the introduction of high dipole moment molecules to the composite. The effect of filler distribution on the dielectric constant was also examined and the observed differences are attributed to the differences in the two kinds of interfaces present: one formed between the touching ZnO particles and the other formed between LDPE and ZnO.", "L165": "Polypropylene (PP) and calcium carbonate nanocomposites were prepared by melt mixing in a Haake mixer. The average primary particle size of the CaCO3 nanoparticles was measured to be about 44nm. The dispersion of the CaCO3 nanoparticles in PP was good for filler content below 9.2vol%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the CaCO3 nanoparticles are a very effective nucleating agent for PP. Tensile tests showed that the modulus of the nanocomposites increased by approximately 85%, while the ultimate stress and strain, as well as yield stress and strain were not much affected by the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles. The results of the tensile test can be explained by the presence of the two-counter balancing forces\u2014the reinforcing effect of the CaCO3 nanoparticles and the decrease in spherulite size of the PP. Izod impact tests suggested that the incorporation of CaCO3 nanoparticles in PP has significantly increased its impact strength by approximately 300%. J-integral tests showed a dramatic 500% increase in the notched fracture toughness. Micrographs of scanning electron microscopy revealed the absence of spherulitic structure for the PP matrix. In addition, DSC results indicated the presence of a small amount of \u03b2 phase PP after the addition of the calcium carbonate nanoparticles. We believe that the large number of CaCO3 nanoparticles can act as stress concentration sites, which can promote cavitation at the particle\u2013polymer boundaries during loading. The cavitation can release the plastic constraints and trigger mass plastic deformation of the matrix, leading to much improved fracture toughness.", "L288": "PMMA/expanded graphite (EG) composites were prepared by direct solution blending of PMMA with the expanded graphite filler. Electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of the composites were measured by a four-point probe resistivity determiner and a dielectric analyzer (DEA). Interestingly, only 1 wt.% filler content was required to reach the percolation threshold (\u03c6) of transition in electrical conductivity from an insulator to a semiconductor using PMMA/EG. The thickness of the interlayer of the expanded graphite was shown to be close to the nanometer scale. The reported filler content was much lower than that required for conventional PMMA/carbon black (8 wt.% carbon) and PMMA/graphite (3.5 wt.% graphite) composites. The improvements in both electrical conductivity and structural integrity were attributed to the difference in filler geometry (aspect ratio and surface area) and the formation of conductive networks in the composites.", "L287": "Graphite oxide (GO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposites were prepared by a novel method utilizing macroazoinitiator (MAI). The MAI, which has a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) segment, was intercalated between the lamellae of GO to induce the inter-gallery polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and exfoliate the GO. The morphological, conductivity, thermal, mechanical and rheological properties of these nanocomposites were examined and compared with those of intercalated nanocomposites prepared by polymerization with the normal radical initiator, 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrile. The improvement in conductivity by GO was more evident in exfoliated nanocomposites compared to that of intercalated nanocomposites. For example, a conductivity of 1.78\u00d710\u22127                      S/cm was attained in the exfoliated nanocomposite prepared with 2.5 parts GO per 100 parts MMA, which was about 50-fold higher than that of the intercalated nanocomposite. The thermal, mechanical and rheological properties also indicate that thin GO with a high aspect ratio is finely dispersed and effectively reinforced the PMMA matrix in both exfoliated and intercalated nanocomposites.", "L275": "In this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were infused into Epon 862 epoxy through a high intensity ultrasonic liquid processor and then mixed with EpiCure curing agent W using a high-speed mechanical agitator. The trapped air and reaction volatiles were removed from the mixture using a high vacuum. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and flexural tests were performed on unfilled, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4wt% CNT-filled epoxy to identify the loading effect on the thermal and mechanical properties of composites. DMA studies revealed that filling the carbon nanotube into epoxy can produce a 90% enhancement in storage modulus and a 22\u00b0C increase in T                      g. However, due to the lower crosslink density of the nanophased systems, a 6\u00b0C decrease in decomposition temperature was observed in the 0.4wt% CNT/epoxy in the TGA test. The flexural results showed that modulus increased with higher CNT loading percentages and the 0.3wt% CNT-infusion system showed the maximum strength enhancement. Based on the experiment's results, a nonlinear constitutive equation was established for neat and nanophased epoxy.", "L394": "A series of polystyrene/silica nanocomposites with different inorganic nanofiller content were prepared by evaporating of toluene solvent. The weight fraction of silica nanoparticles of an average diameter of 7nm treated with hexamethyldisilazane was varied (2, 5, 10, 15 and 30wt.%). The polystyrene nanocomposite morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal stability of the samples was determined using thermogravimetry, coupled with differential scanning calorimetry. The influence of the filler content on glass transition temperature of polystyrene/silica nanocomposites was followed by differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the polystyrene glass transition temperature was influenced by the hydrophobic silica content. A mathematical method to describe the glass transition temperature dependence on the polystyrene/silica ratio is proposed. According to the experimental results and calculations, the highest thermal stability of the nanocomposite belongs to 18% silica content.", "L119": "Multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly(methyl methacrylate) composites have been fabricated by melt blending. The nanotubes are well dispersed in the polymer matrix with no apparent damage or breakage. The dynamic mechanical behavior of the composites has been studied. The storage modulus of the polymer is significantly increased by the incorporation of nanotubes particularly at high temperatures.", "L256": "A series of composites of polycarbonate (PC) with 23 different contents of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) was produced by melt mixing using the masterbatch dilution method. In dielectric measurements, AC conductivity and complex permittivity data obtained in the frequency range between 10\u22123 and 107                      Hz at room temperature indicated the electrical percolation threshold at about 1.0wt%.                   The dynamic mode melt rheological measurements for the same samples at eight temperatures between 170 and 280\u00b0C showed a visible change in the frequency dependence of dynamic moduli and the absolute value of the complex viscosity |\u03b7*| particularly at low frequencies. In literature these changes are sometimes related to so called \u2018percolation threshold concentration\u2019. Applying this picture to our experimental data we have to assume that the percolation threshold is strongly dependent on the measurement temperature. It changes from about 5 to 0.5wt% MWNT by increasing the measurement temperature from 170 to 280\u00b0C, respectively. This temperature dependence cannot be explained by a classical liquid-solid transition but may be related to the existence of a combined nanotube-polymer network.", "L272": "The structure of several rubber\u2013clay nanocomposites, including styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)\u2013clay, natural rubber (NR)\u2013clay, nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR)\u2013clay, carboxylated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (CNBR)\u2013clay nanocomposites, prepared by directly co-coagulating the rubber latex and clay aqueous suspension, were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs showed that these nanocomposites possessed a unique structure, in which the rubber molecules \u201cseparated\u201d the clay particles into either individual layers or just silicate layer aggregates of nanometer thickness without the intercalation of rubber molecules into clay galleries, different from intercalated and exfoliated clay nanocomposites. Such a structure resulted from the competition between separation of rubber latex particles and re-aggregation of single silicate layers during the co-coagulating process. The content of bound rubber of SBR\u2013clay nanocompound is more than that of the corresponding rubber filled with micrometer clay or silica because of the increased networking of silicate layers with the nano-meter dispersion and the high aspect ratio. The glass transition temperature of SBR\u2013clay nanocomposites increased as compared with that of the pure SBR. The tensile strength of SBR\u2013clay nanocomposite loading 20phr clay was 6.0 times higher than that of the conventional SBR\u2013clay composite. The gas permeability of separated rubber\u2013clay nanocomposites containing 20phr decreased 50% as compared with the corresponding gum vulcanizates.", "L231": "Adding nano-sized fillers to epoxy has proven to be an effective method for improving dielectric breakdown strength (DBS). Evidence suggests that dispersion state, as well as chemistry at the filler-matrix interface can play a crucial role in property enhancement. Herein we investigate the contribution of both filler dispersion and surface chemistry on the AC dielectric breakdown strength of silica-epoxy nanocomposites. Ligand engineering was used to synthesize bimodal ligands onto 15nm silica nanoparticles consisting of long epoxy compatible, poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) chains, and short, \u03c0-conjugated, electroactive surface ligands. Surface initiated RAFT polymerization was used to synthesize multiple graft densities of PGMA chains, ultimately controlling the dispersion of the filler. Thiophene, anthracene, and terthiophene were employed as \u03c0-conjugated surface ligands that act as electron traps to mitigate avalanche breakdown. Investigation of the synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles was effective in defining the maximum particle spacing or free space length (Lf) that still leads to property enhancement, as well as giving insight into the effects of varying the electronic nature of the molecules at the interface on breakdown strength. Optimization of the investigated variables was shown to increase the AC dielectric breakdown strength of epoxy composites as much as 34% with only 2wt% silica loading.", "L280": "Silica\u2013PMMA nanocomposites with different silica quantities were prepared by a melt compounding method. The effect of silica amount, in the range 1\u20135wt.%, on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMA was investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR) and measures of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T                      1\u03c1                      (H)), in the laboratory frame (T                      1(H)) and cross-polarization times (T                      CH). Results showed that silica nanoparticles are well dispersed in the polymeric matrix whose structure remains amorphous. The degradation of the polymer occurs at higher temperature in the presence of silica because of the interaction between the two components.", "L236": "Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) based nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending PBAT with 5 and 10wt.% of clay nanoparticles (unmodified and modified montmorillonites, unmodified and modified fluoro-hectorites, and unmodified sepiolites). All nanocomposites showed a good level of clay distribution and dispersion into PBAT, especially nanocomposites with high clay chemical affinity with the polymer matrix. DSC results showed that addition of layered silicates slightly hindered kinetics and extent of crystallization of PBAT; however, sepiolite particles were able to promote polymer crystallization kinetics and the transformation of the PBAT crystal structure to a more ordered form.                   Similar increases in the thermal stability of PBAT in nitrogen and air were obtained upon addition of all clays, due to a barrier effect of the clays toward polymer decomposition product ablation.                   Preliminary biocompatibility tests indicated that PBAT based materials with 10% clay content have good biological safety and display almost no cytotoxicity.                   The addition of all nanofillers increased the hardness of PBAT matrix. The DMA analysis showed that all nanocomposites presented higher E\u2032 values than neat PBAT, indicating that addition of clays improved the mechanical properties of PBAT. For layered silicate nanocomposites, the main influencing factors on the thermo-mechanical properties appeared to be the aspect ratio and dispersion of clay nanoplatelets, rather than polymer/clay chemical affinity. The highest E\u2032 values of sepiolite based nanocomposites make this nanoparticle the most attractive material for tissue engineering and environmental industrial applications.", "L213": "This paper deals with preparation of nanocomposites using modified nanoclay (organoclay) and polypropylene (PP), with, and without compatibilizer (m-TMI-g-PP) to study the effects of modified nanoclay and compatibilizer on viscoelastic properties. Nanocomposites were prepared in two steps; compounding of master batch of nanoclay, polypropylene and m-TMI-g-PP in a torque rheometer and blending of this master-batch with polypropylene in a twin-screw extruder in the specific proportions to yield 3\u20139% nanoclay by weight in the composite. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) tests were carried out to investigate the viscoelastic behavior of virgin polypropylene and nanocomposites. The dynamic mechanical properties such as storage modulus (E\u2032), loss modulus ( E \u2032\u2032 ) and damping coefficient (tan \u03b4) of PP and nano-composites were investigated with and without compatibilizer in the temperature range of \u221240\u00b0C to 140\u00b0C at a step of 5\u00b0C and frequency range of 5Hz to 100Hz at a step of 10Hz. Storage modulus and loss modulus of the nano-composites was significantly higher than virgin polypropylene throughout the temperature range. Storage modulus of the composites increased continuously with increasing nano-content from 3% to 9%. Composites prepared with compatibilizer exhibited inferior storage modulus than the composites without compatibilizer. Surface morphology such as dispersion of nanoclay in the composites with and without compatibilizer was analyzed through Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) that explained the differences in viscoelastic behavior of composites.", "L230": "Functionalisation of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) influences the thermo-mechanical properties of MWCNT/epoxy-composites. Samples based on epoxy resin and different weight percentage of MWCNTs (functionalised and non-functionalised) were prepared. The investigation of the thermo-mechanical behaviour was performed by dynamic-mechanic thermal analysis (DMTA). A dependence of the nanotube content on the glass transition temperature T                      g was observed. An increase in the amount of nanotubes led to an increase of T                      g. Samples containing functionalised nanotubes showed a stronger influence on T                      g in comparison to composites containing the same amount of non-functionalised nanotubes. These results prove the influence of a functionalisation of carbon nanotubes on the interfacial interaction between the polymer and CNT.", "L161": "The study was carried out on nanocomposites consisting of nanoscopic silica fillers embedded in polyamide 6. Various composite systems were prepared through in situ polymerisation, with different elementary particle diameters and filler contents as variables.                   The morphological investigation demonstrated the non influence of the particle presence on the crystalline phase of such composites.                   The introduction of filler leads to an obvious reinforcement of the matrix elastic modulus: the observed increase depends on the modulus difference between the various phases present, the filler content and its dispersion state. In the same way, the yield point, in both compressive and tensile tests, is found to be sensitive to the latter parameters.                   Complementary experiments enable to suggest possible local events leading to the rupture of these composite systems.", "L301": "Poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) swollen in water forms a hydrogel with good biological acceptance but poor mechanical properties. Reinforcement by a nanometric silica phase obtained by acid catalyzed sol\u2013gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane occurring simultaneously with the polymerization of the organic polymer leads to a hybrid material and is a way to improve the mechanical properties of the homopolymer. Dynamic mechanical measurements show a stiffness increase in the rubbery state as the silica content is increased, for both the xerogel (dry) and the swollen samples. Density measurements of the hybrid materials show that the silica phase has an apparent density close to that of vitreous silica, thus giving an indication of the intimate interpenetration of the organic and the inorganic phases in these nanocomposites. Thermogravimetric analysis has been used to probe the dependence of the thermal stability of the samples on the silica content, and to determine the actual silica amounts in each sample. Information about the percolation threshold of the silica phase could be gained from measurements of water uptake and mechanical moduli. All the results pointed out that the co-continuity of matrix and reinforcement starts at around 15wt% of silica content.", "L268": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites were prepared using a novel ultrahigh-shear extruder by directly mixing MWCNT with PVDF in the molten state. A special feedback-type screw was used to obtain a high shear field and obtain a very uniform dispersion of the nanotubes in the polymer matrix under a higher screw rotation speed. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the interaction and dispersion of nanotubes in the PVDF. The linear viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of these composites were investigated. At low-frequencies, the storage shear modulus (G\u2032) becomes almost independent of the frequency as nanotube loading increases, suggesting the onset of solid-like behavior in these composites. By plotting G\u2032 vs. nanotube loading and fitting with a power-law function, we found that the rheological threshold of high-shear processed composites is about 0.96wt% whereas that of low-shear processed composites is about 1.76wt%. The electrical percolation threshold of high-shear processed composites is lower than that of low-shear processed composites.", "L188": "PMMA-silica nanocomposites were prepared using a bulk polymerization technique. Three organic silica groups, two modified with methyl groups and the third an octane, made these inorganic silica particles more hydrophobic. These silica/PMMA nanocomposites exhibited higher storage and loss moduli than those of pristine PMMA. The T                      g of these composites increased with the silica content. The thermal characteristics of these composites were also enhanced by incorporating silica into the PMMA matrix. The degradation temperature at 10% weight loss was approximately 30\u00b0C higher than that of pristine PMMA, depending upon the silica content. The rate of weight loss at 220\u00b0C for 2h was also markedly reduced in the presence of these modified silicas. The results might be attributed to \u201ctrapping effect\u201d. The activation energies for these silica/PMMA nanocomposites were enhanced according to Flynn, Ozawa\u2013Flynn, and Kissinger methods.", "L253": "Composites of MWCNTs having each three different levels of matrix viscosity with five different polymers (polyamide 12, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyetheretherketone and low density polyethylene) were melt mixed to identify the general influence of matrix viscosity on the electrical properties and the state of MWCNT dispersion. Huge differences in the electrical percolation thresholds were found using the same polymer matrix with different viscosity grades. The lowest percolation thresholds were always found in the composites based on the low viscosity matrix. The state of primary MWCNT agglomerate dispersion increased with increasing matrix viscosity due to the higher input of mixing energy. TEM investigations showed nanoagglomerated structures in the low viscosity samples which are obviously needed to achieve low resistivity values. The effect of nanotube shortening was quantified using two different viscosity grades of polycarbonate. Due to the higher mixing energy input the nanotube shortening was more pronounced in the high viscosity matrix which partially explains the higher percolation threshold.", "L220": "Thermal, mechanical, electrical and microwave radiation absorbing properties of conductive composites based on dodecylbenzenesulfonate doped polyaniline/organoclay nanocomposites and propylene\u2013ethylidene\u2013norbornene rubber have been investigated with special interest on the effect of the nanocomposite concentration. Composites were prepared by melt blending using an internal mixer. Morphology studies by scanning electron microscopy of cryofractured surfaces indicated that the conducting nanocomposites produced heterogeneously distributed aggregates in the continuous elastomeric matrix. The composites exhibit high conductivities, up to 10\u22123                      Scm\u22121 for 40wt.% of conducting nanocomposite, and good mechanical properties. They also present high microwave attenuation values, in the frequency range of 8\u201312GHz. This property depends on the concentration of the conductive nanocomposite and on the film thickness. The composites can be used for antistatic coatings or for electromagnetic shielding.", "L183": "Blends were prepared from a high density polyethylene (PE) material and a conductive polycarbonate (PC) composite containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT). The PC composite contained 2wt% MWNT and was prepared by diluting a PC masterbatch consisting of 15wt% MWNT by melt mixing in an extruder. The aim of blending a conductive PC composite with PE was to obtain a conductive blend at lower amounts of MWNT than required for the pure PC component. The blend morphology was found to be co-continuous over a broad composition range of 30\u201380vol.% of the filled PC phase as verified by selective extraction of PC and morphological investigations. The co-continuous structure is very fine with ligaments in the range of 1 \u03bcm. Significantly reduced volume resistivity values, i.e. in the range of 107                      \u03a9cm, could be achieved in the same composition range of that of the continuous PC phase, i.e. starting at compositions of 30vol.% filled PC. Here, the total MWNT content in the blend was only 0.41vol.%. Interestingly, even if the MWNT had been incorporated in the PC phase, the tubes are still visible in the blends after selective extraction of PC. Scanning electron microscopy investigations revealed that the MWNT bridge the PC and PE phases, at least with their ends. This can be understood by the length dimensions of the tubes, which is higher than the phase sizes in the blends.", "L273": "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was grafted onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Composites of PMMA-grafted MWNTs and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) were prepared by solution casting from tetrahydrofuran. Since PMMA is miscible with SAN, the two polymers mix intimately to facilitate the dispersion of PMMA-grafted MWNTs in the SAN matrix. The intimate mixing is evidenced by the transparency of the composites. The incorporation of PMMA-grafted MWNTs to SAN (effective MWNT content=0.5\u20132wt%) leads to increases in storage modulus at 40\u00b0C, Young's modulus, tensile strength, ultimate strain, and toughness by 90, 51, 99, 184 and 614%, respectively. Such simultaneous increases in stiffness, strength, ductility and toughness of a polymer by rigid fillers are rarely observed.", "L196": "The goal of this work was to produce nanocomposites based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW). The CNW were treated with either tert-butanol or a surfactant in order to find a system that would show flow birefringence in chloroform. The nanocomposites were prepared by incorporating 5wt% of the different CNW into a PLA matrix using solution casting. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated whiskers formed flakes, while tert-butanol treated whiskers formed loose networks during freeze drying. The surfactant treated whiskers showed flow birefringence in chloroform and transmission electron microscopy showed that these whiskers produced a well dispersed nanocomposite. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that both whiskers and composite materials were thermally stable in the region between 25\u00b0C and 220\u00b0C. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed that both the untreated and the tert-butanol treated whiskers were able to improve the storage modulus of PLA at higher temperatures and a 20\u00b0C shift in the tan                      \u03b4 peak was recorded for the tert-butanol treated whiskers.", "L257": "The influence of polymer chain orientation as well as multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) alignment on the creep-resistant behavior of nanocomposites has not been fully revealed yet. In this work, tensile and creep behaviors of MWCNT modified polycarbonate nanocomposite fibers produced by melt-spinning at different draw-down ratios have been studied at a temperature of 120 \u00b0C. For fibers with 2 wt.% MWCNTs, it was found that the Young's modulus and creep resistance show clear dependence on the orientation degree of the polymer chains and the alignment of the nanotubes. Parametric studies based on Burger's model and Weibull distribution function were employed to understand the reinforcing mechanisms. Polarized Raman spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate the orientation degree of nanotubes, and further to reveal the variation in alignment during creep deformation. The results show that Raman analysis was consistent with the creep results.", "L157": "There have been several reports of improved ductility and toughness in brittle thermoset polymers due to the addition of equiaxed nanoparticles. The mechanisms leading to this improvement, however, are incompletely understood. In this paper, a model system of nanoscale alumina filled bisphenol A based epoxy with two interface conditions was used to highlight the mechanisms leading to significant improvements in both ductility (max 39%) and modulus (max 18%). Tensile test showed that crack deflection, debonding and plastic deformation of the debonded matrix (plastic void growth) operated for the untreated particles with a relatively weak interface, but that a stronger interface led to enhanced crack deflection and microcracking, and, as a result, a further improvement in properties.", "L323": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/graphite nanoplatelets (PVDF/GNP) composites were fabricated using solution mixing followed by compression molding. The electric conducting and dielectric behavior of such nanocomposites were determined over a wide frequency range from 102 to 107. The results showed that the electrical behavior of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites can be well described by the percolation theory. Both conductivity and dielectric constant were found to be greatly enhanced at the percolation threshold. A large dielectric constant of 173 and low loss tangent of 0.65 were observed in the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite at 1kHz. Moreover, dynamic mechanical analysis was also used to characterize the relaxations of polymers in PVDF/GNP nanocomposites. Dielectric and mechanical relaxations of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites showed strong dependence with frequency and temperature. The activation energy for glass transition determined from mechanical relaxation is considerably higher than that evaluated from the dielectric analysis. This resulted from different operating mechanisms for dielectric and mechanical relaxation processes.", "L312": "TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites were fabricated by using an innovative ultrasonic dual mixing process (UDM) process consists of ultrasonic mixing with simultaneous impeller stirring. TiO2 nanoparticles were used as reinforcement in epoxy resin with weight percentages 5, 10 and 15 respectively. Mechanical properties of each group of composite material were identified using tensile and dynamic mechanical measurements. The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles addition on dynamical mechanical properties of epoxy matrix in the terms of storage modulus and tan\u03b4 value with respect to the temperature at a dynamic heating rate of 2 \u00b0C/min were studied. The dispersion condition of TiO2 content in epoxy matrix has been thoroughly investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. Tensile tests and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on each group of TiO2-epoxy composite to determine their tensile strength, toughness and thermal stability.", "L254": "Five commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), with different characteristics, were melt mixed with polycarbonate (PC) in a twin-screw micro compounder to obtain nanocomposites containing 0.25\u20133.0 wt.% MWNT. The electrical properties of the composites were assessed using bulk electrical conductivity measurements, the mechanical properties of the composites were evaluated using tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and the thermal properties of the composites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Electrical percolation thresholds (p                      cs) were observed between 0.28 wt.% and 0.60 wt.%, which are comparable with other well-dispersed melt mixed materials. Based on measurements of diameter and length distributions of unprocessed tubes it was found that nanotubes with high aspect ratios exhibited lower pc                      s, although one sample did show higher pc                       than expected (based on aspect ratio) which was attributed to poorer dispersion achieved during mixing. The stress\u2013strain behavior of the composites is only slightly altered with CNT addition; however, the strain at break is decreased even at low loadings. DMA tests suggest the formation of a combined polymer-CNT continuous network evidenced by measurable storage moduli at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg                      ), consistent with a mild reinforcement effect. The composites showed lower glass transition temperatures than that of pure PC. Lowering of the height of the tan\u03b4 peak from DMA and reductions in the heat capacity change at the glass transition from DSC indicate that MWNTs reduced the amount of polymer material that participates in the glass transition of the composites, consistent with immobilization of polymer at the nanotube interface.", "L207": "This study aims at investigating the dynamic mechanical, dielectric and rheological properties of reinforced polyurethane (PU) nanocomposites containing hydrophilic graphene oxide (GO) and/or hydrophobic modified graphene oxide (mGO) sheets. The organic modification of GO was performed with 4,4\u2032-methylenebis (phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) and the samples were prepared by solvent mixing. We found that addition of mGO provides a more significant increase in the dielectric permittivity as compared to the addition of GO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy demonstrate the more effective dispersion of thin exfoliated sheets of mGO in the PU matrix as compared to unmodified GO. This qualitative morphology observation is correlated with the quantitative results inferred from the dynamic mechanical analysis, rheology and dielectric studies. The viscoelastic Payne effect is noticed for all nanocomposites and the filler\u2013filler and polymer\u2013filler interactions are studied by applying the Kraus and Maier and Goritz models. The non-linear viscoelastic behavior of the PU nanocomposites is in good agreement with the Maier and Goritz model, which includes the effects of the adsorption/desorption of PU chains on the filler surface. The observed results underline the possibilities of PU composites with organically modified GO sheets in capacitor applications.", "L266": "The potential of using exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets, xGnPTM, as a reinforcement that can produce multifunctional polymer composites was explored. xGnP\u2013polypropylene (PP) composites fabricated by melt mixing using a twin-screw extruder followed by injection molding were investigated for their thermal, viscoelastic and barrier properties as a function of xGnP concentration and aspect ratio. These properties of the xGnP\u2013PP composites were compared to the properties of composites made with PAN-based carbon fibers, VGCF, carbon black and nanoclay. Results indicate that when oriented properly, the xGnP will not only stiffen the composite but also reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion in two directions rather than in one as in the case of aligned fiber composites. Furthermore, the large aspect ratio of xGnP, even at low loadings, increases the oxygen barrier of PP at least as effectively as the commonly used nanoclays and finally, addition of xGnP significantly enhances the thermal conductivity of the polymer matrix.", "L202": "Chemically functionalized exfoliated graphite-filled epoxy composites were prepared with load levels from 2% to 20% by weight. The viscosities of the composites having load levels >4% by weight were over the processing window for the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction revealed a rhombohedral carbon structure in the filler. Enhanced interaction between the epoxy and the graphite filler was evidenced by an improvement in the rubber modulus for the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composites. The thermal and electrical properties of the nanoparticle-filled epoxy composites were measured. The electrical property of the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composite deteriorated. Thermal conductivity of the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composite, however, increased by 28-fold over the pure epoxy resin at the 20% by-weight load level, increasing from 0.2 to 5.8W/mK.", "L167": "BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles with three kinds of diameters were synthesized by alkoxide route and then dispersed into a thermoplastic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and a thermoset polyimide (PI)) to fabricate the BT/PVDF and the BT/PI nanocomposite films.

A significant discrepancy of dielectric behaviors between the BT/PVDF films and the BT/PI films was found. The roles of nanoparticles (size and crystal phase) and properties of polymers (chemistry and chain structure) are used to explain the difference in dielectric behaviors.", "L209": "Alumina/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanocomposites were synthesized using 39-nm nanoparticles and in situ free-radical polymerization. At filler concentrations greater than 0.5 wt.%, the glass transition temperature, T                      g, was observed to decrease precipitously by 25 \u00b0C compared to the neat polymer. At smaller weight fractions, there were no changes in the composite T                      g. The abrupt changes seem to indicate a threshold at which a significant volume fraction of polymer has higher mobility that brings about the decrease in T                      g. Consistent with this behavior, the T                      g depression was suppressed by coating the nanoparticles to make them compatible with the matrix.", "L238": "In an earlier paper [Zhao S, Schadler LS, Hillborg H, Auletta T, Duncan R. Mechanisms leading to improved mechanical performance in nanoscale alumina filled epoxy. Compos Sci Technol 2008], a model system of nanoscale alumina filled bisphenol A based epoxy with two interface conditions was used to highlight the mechanisms leading to significant improvements in ductility, tensile toughness and modulus. In this paper, the fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation (FCP) rate of the materials used in the preceding paper were measured as a function of interface condition to gain further insight into the mechanisms leading to enhanced mechanical performance. No significant improvement in fracture toughness or fracture energy was observed. A significant improvement in FCP resistance was observed for both nanocomposites, but the improvement was larger for the composites with a stronger particle/matrix interface. The crack arresting mechanisms include particle matrix debonding, plastic void growth, and in the nanocomposites with a stronger interface, significant plastic deformation of the matrix around the well-bonded nanoparticles.", "L305": "Polyvinylalcohol/Silica (PVA/SiO2) nanocomposites with different SiO2 contents are synthesized by employing a novel self-assembly monolayer (SAM) technique. The influence of the silica on dynamic mechanical properties of the nanocomposites is investigated by conducting dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and quasi-thermal mechanical analysis (Q-TMA). It is found that the storage modulus (E\u2032), loss factor (tga), glass transition temperature (T                      g), and activation energy (E                      a) of prepared nanocomposites all show a strong dependence on the SiO2 content. The Q-TMA results indicate that under a constant force, the elasticity of nanocomposites decreases with SiO2 content, and the softening temperature moves to a higher temperature when more SiO2 is added.", "L223": "Fumed silica particles with average primary particle diameters of 12 and 40nm were combined with a low viscosity bisphenol E cyanate ester resin to form composite materials with enhanced storage modulus and reduced damping behavior, as evidenced by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The storage modulus increased with volume fraction of fumed silica in both the glassy and rubbery regions, but the increase was more pronounced in the rubbery region. The maximum increase in storage modulus in the glassy region was 75% for 20.7vol% of 40nm fumed silica, while the same composition showed a 231% increase in the rubbery storage modulus. Furthermore, decreases in damping behavior were used to estimate the effective polymer-particle interphase thickness. The glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites was not changed significantly with increasing volume fraction.", "L881": "A simple strategy for the preparation of composites with high dielectric constant and thermal conductivity was developed through a typical interface design. Graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) with a thickness of 20\u201350nm are fabricated and homogeneously dispersed in the epoxy matrix. A high dielectric constant of more than 230 and a high thermal conductivity of 0.54W/mK (a 157% increase over that of pure epoxy) could be obtained for the composites with a lower filler content of 1.892vol.%. The dielectric constant still remains at more than 100 even in the frequency range of 105\u2013106                      Hz. When loaded at 2.703vol.%, GNP/epoxy composites have a dielectric constant higher than 140 in the frequency range of 102\u2013104                      Hz and a high thermal conductivity of 0.72W/mK, which is a 240% increase over that of pure epoxy. The high dielectric constant and low loss tangent are observed in the composite with the GNPs content of 0.949vol.% around 104                      Hz.

The effect of silica nanoparticles on the properties of CBT and its polymer composites has been studied. It was shown that the well-dispersed silica nanoparticles, even in small content (1\u20132wt.%), result in the dramatic extension of the polymerization process of CBT resin. The flexural properties of polymerized PBT nanocomposites, including modulus, yield strength and failure strain, was improved significantly with the incorporation of silica nanoparticles.", "L274": "In situ functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT)/Phenoxy composites were prepared by melt mixing Phenoxy with MWNT and 1-(aminopropyl)imidazole (NIm). Composites with 4.8 wt% or more of in situ functionalized MWNT show higher storage modulus than Phenoxy, provided a sufficient amount of NIm was used to aid in the dispersion of the hydrophobic MWNTs in the hydrophilic Phenoxy matrix.", "L284": "Graphene oxide (GO) prepared using the Hummers\u2019 method is known to be composed of functionalized graphene sheets decorated by strongly-bound oxidative debris that can be removed by a simple base wash. The use of as-made GO and base-washed GO as reinforcing fillers in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposites has been compared through dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and tensile testing. Nanocomposites with loadings from 0.5 to 10wt.% were produced by melt mixing using a twin screw extruder. Large shifts in the values of T                      g for the nanocomposites with respect to PMMA suggest the presence of interactions between the GO and polymer. Thermogravimetric analysis also revealed a significant increase in the decomposition temperatures upon the addition of the GO. Optimal loadings of 1wt.% were found for both fillers, up to which substantial mechanical reinforcement was observed. Comparison with previous nanotube systems, suggests that there was a good dispersion of both fillers below 1wt.%, with aggregation and a deterioration of the mechanical properties occurring at higher loadings. Stress-induced shifts of the Raman D band in the GO revealed the existence of stress-transfer from the PMMA matrix to the fillers during deformation. Overall the as-made GO gave nanocomposites with better properties than those reinforced with based-washed material. Hence, it appears that the presence of the oxidative debris in GO, which acts as a compatibilising surfactant, is beneficial in producing nanocomposites with both a good dispersion and a strong interface between GO and a polymer matrix.", "L147": "Poly(glycidyl methacrylate) polymer brushes were grafted onto TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces via a combination of phosphate ligand engineering and Cu-catalyzed alkyne-azide \u201cclick\u201d reaction. The grafted TiO2 nanoparticles are compatible with a commercial epoxy resin enabling the preparation of thick (1 mm) transparent high-refractive index TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites. In order to maximize the volumetric loading and thereby the refractive index of nanocomposites, the minimum graft densities that can lead to high optical transparency were identified. It was found that, when the graft density was too low to form polymer brushes, the dispersion of the grafted particles changed from a dispersed state to an agglomerated state. The transition of the dispersion state was in good agreement with the theoretical prediction from a parametric model. This good agreement will facilitate the design and fabrication of transparent polymer nanocomposites filled with grafted nanoparticles. With 30 wt% loading of TiO2 nanoparticles, the refractive index of TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites increased from 1.5 for neat epoxy to 1.62. The transparency of the prepared nanocomposites can be well predicted by the Raleigh scattering model.", "L296": "The organic\u2013inorganic hybrid nanocomposites comprising of poly(iminohexamethyleneiminoadipoyl), better known as Polyamide-6,6 (abbreviated henceforth as PA66), and silica (SiO2) were synthesized through sol\u2013gel technique at ambient temperature. The inorganic phase was generated in situ by hydrolysis\u2013condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in different concentrations, under acid catalysis, in presence of the organic phase, PA66, dissolved in formic acid. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the microstructural evolution of the silica phase in the PA66 matrix. Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies showed that the crystallinity in PA66 phase decreased with increasing silica content. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the nanocomposite films revealed the dispersion of SiO2 particle with dimensions of <100nm in the form of network as well as linear structure. X-ray silicon mapping further confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of the silica phase in the bulk of the organic phase. The melting peak temperatures slightly decreased compared to neat PA66, while an improvement in thermal stability by about 20\u00b0C was achieved with hybrid nanocomposite films, as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) exhibited significant improvement in storage modulus (E\u2032) for the hybrid nanocomposites over the control specimen. An increase in Young's modulus and tensile strength of the hybrid films was also observed with an increase in silica content, indicating significant reinforcement of the matrix in the presence of nanoparticles. Some properties of the in situ prepared PA66-silica nanocomposites were compared with those of conventional composites prepared using precipitated silica as the filler by solution casting from formic acid.", "L310": "A systematic study has been conducted to investigate the matrix properties by introducing nanosize TiO2 (5\u201340nm, 0.5\u20132% by weight) fillers into an epoxy resin. Ultrasonic mixing process, via sonic cavitations, was employed to disperse the particles into the resin system. The thermal, mechanical, morphology and the viscoelastic properties of the nanocomposite and the neat resin were measured with TGA, DMA, TEM and Instron. The nano-particles are dispersed evenly throughout the entire volume of the resin. The nanofiller infusion improves the thermal, mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the epoxy resin. The nanocomposite shows increase in storage modulus, glass transition temperature, tensile modulus, flexural modulus and short beam shear strength from neat epoxy resin. The mechanical performance and thermal stability of the epoxy nanocomposites are depending on with the dispersion state of the TiO2 in the epoxy matrix and are correlated with loading (0.0015\u20130.006% by volume). In addition, the nanocomposite shows enhanced flexural strength. Several reasons to explain these effects in terms of reinforcing mechanisms were discussed.", "L246": "In order to obtain epoxy nanocomposites with excellent mechanical properties at cryogenic temperature, an efficient method to functionalize graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) is proposed. Through a simple dip-coating procedure, the GNPs were first functionalized with deposition of polydopamine coating (PDA@GNPs). Then, using polydopamine as a bridge, the PDA@GNPs were modified with amine groups after polyetheramine T403 grafting (T403-PDA@GNPs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses proved the successful functionalization of PDA and polyetheramine T403 on the surface of GNPs. Adding 0.1 wt% T403-PDA@GNPs significantly improved the cryogenic tensile strength and impact strength of the epoxy nanocomposites by 34.5% and 64.5%, which showed greater reinforcing effect than the pristine GNPs (12.6% and 19.1%) and PDA@GNPs (26.3% and 50.1%). The results of dynamic mechanical analysis and scanning electron microscopy observations indicated that the PDA and further polyetheramine T403 functionalization improved the interfacial interactions between GNPs and matrix, which ensured the much improved mechanical properties.", "L166": "A simple strategy for the preparation of composites with high dielectric constant and thermal conductivity was developed through a typical interface design.

The effect of the crystalline phase and the amount of titania, in the range 1\u20135 wt.%, on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMA was investigated by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C{1H}CP-MAS NMR), including the measurement of proton spin\u2013lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T                      1\u03c1(H)), in the laboratory frame (T                      1(H)) and cross polarization times (T                      CH), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

When the filler\u2013filler spacing is on the order of the polymeric matrix molecular size, fillers may agglomerate through direct short-range interactions, also by overlapping of interfacial layers of neighboring fillers. In this work the effect of interfacial layer on the viscoelastic properties of silica/polystyrene composite was investigated.                   The Si/Ps nanocomposites were prepared by solution mixing method, and dynamic rheometry was employed to determine the viscoelastic behavior in the melt state. Experimental results show that, addition of silica nanoparticles to polystyrene matrix would increase the glass-transition temperature of polymer. This increasing will be accelerated by presence of nanoparticles with more filler\u2013polymer adhesion energy, because of more interfacial layer volume fraction. It is helpful in evaluating the volume fraction and equivalent thickness of interfacial layer in polymer nanocomposites. Likewise it is shown that, the dynamic moduli of nanocomposite is enhanced associated with the increase in the glass-transition temperature. This study implies that the main source of increment in both dynamic modulus and glass-transition temperature of polymer nanocomposites is the presence of the immobilized interfacial layer and the secondary filler network.", "L154": "The filler/matrix interface in fiber-reinforced polymer composites is critical in controlling load transfer from the matrix to the fiber, failure mechanisms, and degradation. It is not clear, however, how the mechanisms of load transfer in traditional composites apply to nanofiber-filled polymers. This paper is focused on understanding the reinforcement mechanisms in multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC) composites. Strain dependent Raman spectroscopy shows that there is load transfer from the matrix to the nanotubes, and that the efficiency of the load transfer is improved by surface modification of the MWCNT. Dynamic mechanical analysis as well as electron microscopy reveals the presence of a large annular interphase region of immobilized polymer surrounding the embedded nanotubes. Micromechanical modeling of the elastic modulus of the composite that accounts for the limited load transfer to the interior shells of the MWCNT suggests this immobilized polymer provides an additional reinforcement mechanism that is unique for nano-filled composites.", "L316": "Epoxy based polymer nano-composite was prepared by dispersing graphite nano-platelets (GNPs) using two different techniques: three-roll mill (3RM) and sonication combined with high speed shear mixing (Soni_hsm). The influence of addition of GNPs on the electrical and thermal conductivity, fracture toughness and storage modulus of the nano-composite was investigated. The GNP/epoxy prepared by 3RM technique showed a maximum electrical conductivity of 1.8\u00d710\u221203 S/m for 1.0wt% which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than those prepared by Soni_hsm. The percentage of increase in thermal conductivity was only 11% for 1.0wt% and 14% for 2.0wt% filler loading. Dynamic mechanical analysis results showed 16% increase in storage modulus for 0.5wt%, although the Tg did not show any significant increase. Single edge notch bending (SENB) fracture toughens (K IC) measurements were carried out for different weight percentage of the filler content. The toughening effect of GNP was most significant at 1.0wt% loading, where a 43% increase in K IC was observed.

In situ X-ray scattering during deformation indicated that these mechanical enhancements arise not only from the CNTs, but also from their impact on soft-segment crystallization. The deformation behavior after yielding of the nanocomposites, irrespective of CNT concentration, is similar to the unfilled elastomer, implying that the mechanistics of large deformation is mainly governed by the matrix. The relative enhancement of the Young's modulus of the nanocomposites is comparable to other elastomeric nanocomposites, implying that to the first order specific chemical details of the elastomeric system is unimportant.", "L199": "This paper presents a bulk composite method for determining the critical aspect ratio and relative interfacial shear stress (ISS) for multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites. Through a modified pullout test and fragmentation test, it was found that the critical aspect ratio was 300 and decreased by a factor of 3 due to surface modification, and that MWNTs at an angle of greater than 60\u00b0 to the loading direction failed in bending instead of pulling out of the matrix. Finite element analysis was used to determine the critical bending shear strength and MWNT modulus. The obtained bending shear strength was used in a mechanics model developed to provide bounds for the ISS in the experimental composite system. The calculated ISS for as-received nanotube falls between 4.8 and 13.7MPa, and for surface treated nanotube falls in the range of 11.1 and 38.3MPa. These values are consistent with the ISS reported for carbon fiber/polymer composites and also show that the ISS almost triples due to chemical modification of the MWNT surface.", "L291": "In this study, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)-based hybrid materials were prepared from reactive silica nanoparticles.

It was found that with the addition of one weight percent of MWNTs, the Young\u2019s modulus of polymer foams increased by as much as 82%, and the collapse strength increased by as much as 104%. The influence of MWNT aspect ratio on the compressive properties of nanocomposite foams was investigated. The addition of MWNTs influenced the foam properties in two ways: improving the compressive properties of the solid matrix, and reducing the bubble size of the nanocomposite foams. A modified constitutive model for predicting the compressive properties of high density closed-cell polymer foams was developed. The influence of the bubble size on the mechanical properties of polymer foams was discussed based on the new model.", "L212": "Thermal degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is accelerated in the presence of commercial organoclays, and this remains a challenge for the industry. While a high level of clay delamination is required in polymer nanocomposites, thermal degradation increases furthermore for highly exfoliated morphologies due to an increased exposure of the polymer matrix to silicate nanoplatelets. In this work, two different types of organomodified clay were melt blended with PET in the presence of a multifunctional epoxy-based chain extender, Joncryl\u00ae ADR-4368F (Joncryl), to compensate for molecular weight reduction during processing. The chain extender was added via a master-batch approach in order to promote clay delamination before molecular weight increase. The morphological, rheological, mechanical, thermal, and gas barrier characteristics of the nanocomposites were studied using several characterization techniques. A remarkable improvement in viscoelastic properties was observed for samples containing the chain extender due to recoupling of degraded chains. A better clay dispersion, enhanced barrier properties and increased Young modulus were also obtained for nanocomposites containing the chain extender.

The morphology and degree of dispersion of the MWCNTs in the PE matrix at different length scales was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Both individual and agglomerations of MWCNTs were evident. An up-shift of 17cm\u22121 for the G band and the evolution of a shoulder to this peak were obtained in the Raman spectra of the nanocomposites, probably due to compressive forces exerted on the MWCNTs by PE chains and indicating intercalation of PE into the MWCNT bundles.

A percolation threshold of about 7.5wt% was obtained and the electrical conductivity of PE was increased significantly, by 16 orders of magnitude, from 10\u221220 to 10\u22124                      S/cm.

The Si/Ps nanocomposites were prepared by solution mixing method, and dynamic rheometry was employed to determine the viscoelastic behavior in the melt state. Experimental results show that, addition of silica nanoparticles to polystyrene matrix would increase the glass-transition temperature of polymer.

It is helpful in evaluating the volume fraction and equivalent thickness of interfacial layer in polymer nanocomposites. Likewise it is shown that, the dynamic moduli of nanocomposite is enhanced associated with the increase in the glass-transition temperature.

The results showed that grafting silane molecules onto the CNT surface improved the dispersion of CNTs in epoxy along with much enhanced mechanical and thermal properties as well as fracture resistance of nanocomposites compared to those containing CNTs without functionalization. The electrical conductivity of nanocomposites decreased due to the wrapping of CNTs with non-conductive silane molecules.

In contrast to this conventional wisdom, we show that ductility can be substantially increased, while maintaining gains in the elastic modulus and yield stress, in glassy nanocomposite films composed of spherical silica NPs grafted with polystyrene (PS) chains in a PS matrix. The key to these improvements are (i) uniform NP spatial dispersion and (ii) strong interfacial binding between NPs and the matrix, by making the grafted chains sufficiently long relative to the matrix. Strikingly, the optimal conditions for the mechanical reinforcement of the same nanocomposite material in the melt state is completely different, requiring the presence of spatially extended NP clusters.

In this paper we develop quantitative relationships between interfacial surface energy parameters and the dispersion and Tg shifts of PNCs through systematic experiments on an array of hybrid systems spanning a wide range of interfacial interactions. We use four different matrices of surface energies varying from polar to nonpolar (poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA), and polystyrene (PS)), filled with three monofunctional-silane modifications of colloidal silica nanospheres (octyldimethylmethoxysilane, chloropropyldimethylethoxysilane, and aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane). We hypothesize the ratio of the work of adhesion between filler and polymer to the work of adhesion of filler to filler (WPF/WFF), in conjunction with the relative work of adhesion (\u0394Wa), can be used to predict the final state of particle dispersion. Additionally, the direction and magnitude of Tg deviation from the neat polymer are hypothesized to depend on the work of spreading (Ws) and the dispersion state.

While mechanical measurements give access to the overall response of the nanocomposite material, measurements of the chain segment average orientation induced upon uniaxial stretching give selective access to the response of the elastomer matrix only. Average segment orientation is measured by X-ray scattering. Reinforcement effects are analyzed in terms of the enhancement ratio of the mechanical modulus or induced segmental orientation in a reinforced sample over the corresponding quantity measured in the pure matrix. Cross-link densities are measured independently by NMR to account for possible impact of fillers on the cross-link density. It is demonstrated that in filled materials the orientational enhancement ratio does not decrease significantly as temperature increases, while the mechanical reinforcement ratio decreases as temperature increases, as it is known already. Also, the mechanical reinforcement ratio increases considerably as the silica fraction increases beyond a threshold, which is generally attributed to percolation or onset of filler networking, while the orientational reinforcement ratio qualitatively follows a Guth and Gold type of variation, associated solely with the geometrical (or hydrodynamical) local strain amplification contribution. Comparison of both mechanical and orientational responses thus allows discriminating and quantifying rigid network contribution from strain amplification contribution to reinforcement as a function of either temperature or filler volume fraction.

However, SR gels show an unusual fracture behavior that contradicts this trade-off relation. The fracture energy of SR gels is independent of the Young\u2019s modulus, in other words, the cross-linking density; moreover, it rises with increasing slidable range of movable cross-links on polymer chains.

Herein, a new strategy for the development of polymer composites with high permittivity and low dielectric loss has been proposed based on morphology-controllable graphene\u2013TiO2 nanorod hybrid nanostructures. These hybrid nanostructures possess large aspect ratio, high surface area and high electric conductivity graphene sheets, which provide ideal electrodes in the construction of microcapacitors. In addition, the morphology-controllable TiO2 nanorod decoration effectively prevents direct contact between the graphene sheets in the composite, which give advantages for forming a large microcapacitor network and suppressing the leakage current. As a consequence, a polystyrene composite with 10.9 vol% graphene\u2013TiO2 nanorod sheets exhibits a very high permittivity of 1741 at 102 Hz, which is 643 times higher than the value for pure polystyrene (2.7), and low dielectric loss (tan\u03b1) of only 0.39. The permittivity of the composites can be controlled by controlling the amount of nanorod decoration on the graphene substrates, which provides a new pathway for tuning the permittivity of polymer composites.

However, by a calculation, the percolation threshold of the MWNT/PVDF composites is only 1.61vol% (0.0161 volume fraction) of MWNT. Both the large aspect ratio and the high conductivity of the MWNT may lead to the low percolation threshold of the MWNT/PVDF composites.

Transparent sol-gel-derived organic-inorganic nanocomposites were successfully prepared by in situ incorporation of a silica network into poly(trimethylhexamethylene terephthalamide) using diethylamine as catalyst. Thin films containing various proportions of inorganic network obtained by evaporating the solvent were characterized using mechanical, dynamic mechanical thermal and morphological analyses.  RESULTS: Tensile measurements indicate that modulus as well as stress at yield and at break point improved while elongation at break and toughness decreased for the hybrid materials. The maximum value of stress at yield point (72 MPa) was observed with 10 wt% silica while the maximum stress at break point increased up to 66 MPa with 20 wt% silica relative to that of pure polyamide (44 MPa). Tensile modulus was found to increase up to 2.59 GPa with 10 wt% silica in the matrix. The glass transition temperature and the storage moduli increased with increasing silica content. The maximum increase in the Tg value (144 \u00b0C) was observed with 20 wt% silica. Scanning electron microscopy investigation gave the distribution of silica, with an average particle size ranging from 3 to 24 nm.

BT-Ag hybrid particles were synthesized via a seed-mediated growing process by a redox reaction between silver nitrate and ethylene glycol. Nano Ag particles with a size less than 20 nm were discretely grown on the surface of the 100 nm BaTiO3. The similar lattice spacing of the (1 1 1) planes of BT and Ag led to the hetero-epitaxial growth of Ag on the BT surface. The thickness of the coherent interface was about 3 nm. The adhesion of Ag to BT efficiently prevented the continuous contact between Ag particles in the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix and suppressed the formation of the conducting path in the composite. As a result, with a filler loading of 43.4 vol %, the composite exhibited a dielectric constant (Dk) value of 94.3 and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of 0.06 at 1 kHz.

Relative density was found to be the most important one, with the storage modulus following a power-law behavior with increasing relative density. Foams prepared in one-step presented higher storage moduli than two-step foams even having bigger cells, explained by their higher relative density.

A slight effect of GnP could only be observed in two-step foams with 5% GnP, as these foams displayed storage moduli as high as one-step foams having lower relative densities.

Multi-shape memory was induced using a tensile test machine equipped with the hot oven at 65 and 100 \u00b0C.

At high temperature, amorphous phases of two polymers are extended and un-melted chains of PMMA can be as hard segment and leads to good recovery. Due to nucleation and reinforcement effects of GNP, the higher degree of crystallization of PLA and higher storage modulus were obtained and caused to the enhancement of the shape fixity values at the presence of GNP.

For the determination of the reason for the Tg depression, the thermomechanical and dielectric relaxation processes of the silica nanocomposites have been investigated with dynamic mechanical analysis and dielectric analysis. The Tg depression is related to the enhanced polymer dynamics due to the extra free volume at the resin\u2013filler interface.

Tensile and flexural properties measurements of these nanocomposites indicated higher modulus and strength with increasing concentration of small GnPs sizes (<1 \u03bcm, GnP-C750). The incorporation of larger GnPs sizes (~5 \u03bcm, GnP-5) significantly improved the tensile and flexural modulus but reduced the strength of the resulting composites.

Using high aspect ratio fillers is a promising route for creating high dielectric constant, low loss materials at a low filler volume fraction, for use as capacitor and electric field grading materials. In this work, two high aspect ratio fillers were mixed into a polymer matrix, and the dielectric properties of composites were studied. Barium titanate fibers were synthesized by electrospinning a sol-gel, followed by a heat treatment to obtain a perovskite crystal structure. The heat treatment conditions were found to be crucial for obtaining tetragonal barium titanate fibers with high dielectric constant. Graphene platelets were prepared by a thermal shock method, which was found to result in a larger dielectric constant. A combination of barium titanate and graphene platelets yielded the highest dielectric constant when used in a polydimethyl siloxane matrix. The increase in dielectric loss over the pure matrix was small when the volume fraction was below the percolation threshold of graphene platelets. Electric flux density-electric field (D-E) measurements showed a linear dielectric constant in barium titanate filled composites and higher loss when graphene was added.

For alumina nanocomposites, Tg increases relative to Tg,bulk by as much as 16 K in P2VP, decreases by as much as 5 K in PMMA, and is invariant in PS. By analogy with thin polymer films, these results are explained by wetted P2VP\u2013nanofiller interfaces with attractive interactions, nonwetted PMMA\u2013nanofiller interfaces (free space at the interface), and wetted PS\u2013nanofiller interfaces lacking attractive interactions, respectively. The presence of wetted or nonwetted interfaces is controlled by choice of solvent. For example, 0.1\u20130.6 vol % silica/PMMA nanocomposites exhibit Tg enhancements as large as 5 K or Tg reductions as large as 17 K relative to Tg,bulk when films are made from methyl ethyl ketone or acetic acid solutions, respectively. A factor of 17 reduction of physical aging rate relative to that of neat, bulk P2VP is demonstrated in a 4 vol % alumina/ P2VP nanocomposite.

This \u201csacrificial bond\u201d rupture dissipates enormous amounts of energy and reveals significant hidden lengths due to unraveling of the highly coiled macromolecules, leaving the structural integrity of their covalent backbones intact to large extensions. In this work, we present the first evidence of similar sacrificial bond mechanisms in the inorganic phase of composites using inexpensive stacked-cup carbon nanofibers (CNF), which are composed of helically coiled graphene sheets with graphitic spacing between adjacent layers. These CNFs are dispersed in a series of high-performance epoxy systems containing trifunctional and tetrafunctional resins, which are traditionally difficult to toughen in light of their highly cross-linked networks. Nonetheless, the addition of only 0.68 wt % CNF yields toughness enhancements of 43 - 112% for the various blends. Analysis of the relevant toughening mechanisms reveals two heretofore unseen mechanisms using sacrificial bonds that complement the observed crack deflection, rupture, and debonding/pullout that are common to many composite systems. First, embedded nanofibers can splay discretely between adjacent graphitic layers in the side walls; second, crackbridging nanofibers can unravel continuously. Both of these mechanisms entail the dissipation of the \u03c0 - \u03c0 interactions between layers in the side walls without compromising the structural integrity of the graphene sheets. Moreover, increases in electrical conductivity of ~ 7 - 10 orders of magnitude were found, highlighting the multifunctionality of CNFs as reinforcements for the design of tough, inexpensive nanocomposites with improved electrical properties.
